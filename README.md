# Time and Material Report Automation

This Python script automates the process of generating and processing a weekly timesheet report from a web application. It uses Selenium to interact with the web elements, downloads the report in Excel format, and performs data manipulation using Pandas and Openpyxl.

## Features:

- Automates login to a web application.
- Navigates to the report generation page.
- Selects the appropriate report type and date range.
- Downloads the report in Excel format.
- Cleans and processes the downloaded Excel file.
- Creates a pivot table summarizing the data.
- Saves the final report in a new Excel file.

## Usage:

1. Install the required Python libraries: Selenium, Pandas, Openpyxl.
2. Replace the URL, username, and password with your specific credentials.
3. Run the script using the command: `python time_and_material_report.py`.
4. The script will generate the report and save it as `output_file.xlsx`.

## Notes:

- The script is designed to work with a specific web application and may require modifications to work with different applications.
- The script assumes that the downloaded Excel file is in a specific format. If the format changes, the data processing steps may need to be adjusted.
- The script uses hard-coded locators to interact with the web elements. If the web elements change, the locators will need to be updated.
